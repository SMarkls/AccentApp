# AccentApp
Application for training one of the exercises with accents in the Unified State Examination in the Russian language.    
## The essence of the exercise is that you need to find the vowel which has the accent.  
On the exam itself, the task is somewhat different. Five words are given there, where the capital letter is highlighted, which may be accented. However, only one is correct. ![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91720469/180245430-ad006d25-c748-48ce-abf9-7f935aa28c82.png "Example").   
Therefore, to pass the exam you need to memorize all the words. This app will help you do it.
